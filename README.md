# REMU-V

REMU-V will be a full RISC-V emulator which is coded in C and takes the input in pure
RISC-V assembly code. For the time being I don't have any plan on making a compiler, 
since some compilation tools for RISC-V already exist, although very annoying to get
started with.


## Getting started
To compile simply use cmake.

```bash
cmake -B build/
```



## Who is this project for
- Mainly anyone who finds an interest on learning the ISA of RISC-V in a practical way. 
- Anyone who wants to contribute to an emulator repository.
- Anyone with a deep interest in assembly code and contributing to open source.


## Features supported
- REMU-V will try to implement 32 bit, 64 bit instructions and any future additions
to RISC-V in the future.
